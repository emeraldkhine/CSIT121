        <h3>Lab 02 Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          My first webpage! At first, the process seemed daunting, with so many
          tags and structures to remember, but breaking it down step by step made
          it manageable. Learning how to properly structure an HTML document
          helped me understand how webpages are built and displayed.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>I learned how to structure a basic HTML page using &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;.</li>
          <li>I learned how to use headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize content.</li>
          <li>I learned how to add links and follow web standards using trusted sources like MDN and W3Schools.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Learning about basic structure was another exciting step. I just learned how to write &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;.</p>

        <ul>

          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></li>

        <h3>Lab 03 Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This lab introduced me to CSS, and I love how powerful it
          is for controlling the look of a webpage. Connecting an external
          stylesheet to my HTML file felt like easy to maintain. I could
          change colors, fonts, and spacing all in one place without touching the
          HTML structure. I found the difference between ID and class selectors.
          I was confused about when to use padding versus margin but I searched online and read abut it. I want to
          explore more CSS properties in future labs. Resources that helped me
          the most were MDN Web Docs and the YouTuber Dave Gray. His tutorials are clear and easy to understand.
        </p>

        <h3>New Things I Learned</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>How to link an external CSS file using the &lt;link&gt; element in &lt;head&gt;.</li>
          <li>How to style elements using selectors like body, h1, p, and a.</li>
          <li>The difference between ID selectors (#) and class selectors (.).</li>
          <li>Different between padding and margin.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Additional resources I used for this lab:</p>

          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">MDN: CSS First Steps</a></li>
