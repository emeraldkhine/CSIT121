          My first webpage! At first, the process seemed daunting, with so many
          tags and structures to remember, but breaking it down step by step made
          it manageable. Learning how to properly structure an HTML document
          helped me understand how webpages are built and displayed.

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>I learned how to structure a basic HTML page using &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;.</li>
          <li>I learned how to use headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize content.</li>
          <li>I learned how to add links and follow web standards using trusted sources like MDN and W3Schools.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Learning about basic structure was another exciting step. I just learned how to write &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MND Web Docs</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></li>
        </ul>
